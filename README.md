This project aims to unify the use of various RGB-devices.   
**It is currently under heavy development and will have breaking changes in the future!** Right now a lot of devices aren't working as expected and there are bugs/unfinished features. Please think about that when you consider using the library in this early stage.   
   
If you want to help with layouting/testing devices or if you need support using the library feel free to join the [RGB.NET discord-channel](https://discord.gg/9kytURv).

For a quick-start-guide you can check out [this issue](https://github.com/DarthAffe/RGB.NET/issues/2).
